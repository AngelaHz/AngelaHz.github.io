            I was able to do this project much easier because of how similar Illustrator was to Photoshop. The hair and tail on the mermaid was the most difﬁcult part of the image, because I had to do each part of the hair separately. Since my raster project’s colors were more on the warmer side, so I wanted to do the opposite for this one.
