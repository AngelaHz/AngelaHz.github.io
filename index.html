            My name is Angela Huang. I am trying to become an animator in the future, so this class has been a great step forward. I usually only stick with traditional medias when it comes to art, so I wanted to understand how to use programs like Photoshop and Adobe Animate, but I didnâ€™t even know where to begin. This class has really taught me everything that I wanted to learn.
