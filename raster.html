            The raster project was difficult for me in the beginning, because I was very new to Photoshop. It took me a while, but I ﬁnally became accustomed to the layout and the tools. I am very satisﬁed with how the image and colors look. I was inspired by surreal painting and I wanted to make the image very dreamlike.
